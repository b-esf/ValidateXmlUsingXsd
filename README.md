# ValidateXmlUsingXsd

This console application uses a provided XSD to validate a provided XML file.
Any warnings or errors are displayed to the console.
Currently, the program takes test_xml.xml and validates it against test_xsd.xsd from the current user's Desktop.


TODO:  
-Change from console to GUI  
-Allow user to choose XML and XSD files from any location.
